## Installation

You will need Rust and Cargo for compilation. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for installation instructions.

Use `cargo build --release` to compile the code. (The release-flag is optional, but highly recommended for improved performance.)

## Usage

Run the program with `cargo run --release -- <SUBCOMMAND> <COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS>` or execute the binary in the `target`-folder. See `cargo run --release -- help` for information about subcommands and command line arguments. (TODO: Information about arguments in this readme)
